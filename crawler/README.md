# GBIF Crawler

The Crawler main library provides the crawlers for each of Biocase, Digir, and Tapir as well as different crawling strategies (e.g. name ranges). It is used by the crawler-cli to start services that can run crawls in response to received messages.

## To build the project
```
mvn clean install
```
